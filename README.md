# My Daily Planner

A clean and simple task planner web app made using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. It helps you keep track of your daily tasks — you can add, check off, delete, and search tasks. Everything is saved in your browser using localStorage, so your tasks stay even if you refresh the page.

## What You Can Do

- Add tasks.
- Search through your tasks as you type. 
- Mark tasks as complete.
- Delete tasks one by one or clear all at once.
- Tasks are saved even after closing the browser (using localStorage).
- “Back to Top” button shows up on scroll for easy navigation.
